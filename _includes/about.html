                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">Dr. Henry K Stark is a Podiatry Specialist who returned to Lake Park in October, 2020. Dr. Stark graduated with honors from New York College Of Podiatric Medicine in 1978.  He then trained for two additional years in Pittsburgh Hospitals learning extensive, post-graduate surgical techniques. In 1980, Dr. Stark moved to Florida to begin his career in Lake Park as an associate. Six years later, he opened his own practice as a Podiatrist, Foot and Ankle Surgeon.  For the next 35 years, Dr. Stark expanded his practice, hiring associates and forming a partnership, eventually encompassing four offices in the Northern half of Palm Beach County.  After selling his practice in 2015, Dr. Stark had retired after actively practicing extensively and on staff at nine area hospitals, including Jupiter Medical Center, Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, Good Samaritan Medical Center, St Mary's Medical Center, JFK Medical Centers amoung others.  He returned to his original location at 701 Park Avenue, Lake Park, reopening as Lake Park Podiatry. Dr. Stark's goal is to provide his patients with the most trusted, modern podiatry care but with that old-fashioned touch. As of June 3, 2024, the office of Podiatrist Henry K. Stark, DPM, Lake Park Podiatry, LLC, has been sold. Dr. Stark is no longer in active practice.
